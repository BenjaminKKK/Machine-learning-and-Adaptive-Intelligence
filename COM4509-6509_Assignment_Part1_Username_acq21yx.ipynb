    "### Please READ the whole assignment first, before starting to work on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How and what to submit\n",
    "\n",
    "A. A **Jupyter Notebook** with the code in all the cells executed and outputs displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Name your Notebook **COM4509-6509_Assignment_Part1_Username_XXXXXX.ipynb** where XXXXXX is your username such as such as abc18de.  \n",
    "\n",
    "C. Upload a .zip file to Blackboard before the deadline that contains the Jupyter Notebook in B and any other files requested for the solution of Part 2 of the Assignment (Dr Lu will be in charge of releasing this part). \n",

    "**\"Any form of unfair means is treated as a serious academic offence and action may be taken under the Discipline Regulations.\"** (from the students Handbook). Please carefully read [this link](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/comughandbook/general-information/assessment/unfair-means) on what constitutes Unfair Means if not sure, for COM4509. If you are taking COM6509, please read [this link](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/compgtstudenthandbook/menu/referencing-unfair-means) if you are not sure what is Unfair means.
